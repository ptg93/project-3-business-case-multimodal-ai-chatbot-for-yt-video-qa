This is my final Ironhack AI bootcamp project. 
In the notebooks folder you will find different versions of my code, with different working bits:
An older version, with Diarization working but missing uploading from device, dynamic whisper model etc.
A newer version, the one I was trying to deploy, with some added functionalities including widgets for running more comfortably.
The "beta" version in which I was trying to get computer vision to work.

Neither deployment ended up working, but I am adding both attempts, docker and streamlit, here.

You can also find two .pdf files with the presentation and report and a Task.md file which contains the Project outline and requirements shared with us.

In this repository there are no API_Keys, make sure to add a .env file with your own if you want to run the code.
